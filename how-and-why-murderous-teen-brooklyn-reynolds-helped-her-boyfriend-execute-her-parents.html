Troubled teen <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Brooklyn Reynolds</a></strong> took that fateful step.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=225 data-current-count=225 data-injectable=false>In one of the more disturbing <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">true crime</a> tales of the past decade: Reynolds conspired with her boyfriend to murder her parents because they forbade her from seeing him, and then staged the crime scene to look like a break-in.</p><p data-characters=225 data-current-count=450 data-injectable=true>The background to the incident was Brooklyn’s parents’ concern for their daughter dating an older man named <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Christopher Evans</a>. Evans was 22 at the time of the killing and had been dating Brooklyn since she was 15.</p><p data-characters=262 data-current-count=262 data-injectable=false>Reynolds kept this <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">important age detail</a> secret from her parents, but after perusing her phone, they found out not only his age but intimate pictures of the two. Her parents, Henry and Chara Bryant wanted to protect their daughter, but that cost them their lives.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=562 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=231 data-current-count=231 data-injectable=false>It <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">took a while</a> for Henry and Chara to find each other and get married for good. They were familiar when they were younger – Chara had a thing for Henry way back in middle school and high school, when he was on the football team.</p><p data-characters=301 data-current-count=532 data-injectable=true>They both went through multiple relationships before finally finding each other again and combining their families in a house in Mount Vernon, Kentucky. It was a slow-moving community, away from the bustle of the city. The kind of town where everyone knew each other and looked out for each other too.</p><p data-characters=273 data-current-count=273 data-injectable=false>They married in 2002 and combined families; Chara had three children from a previous marriage (including Brooklyn) and they eventually had a daughter together. Things were good until they weren’t. As the girls got older, they got more rebellious, especially Brooklyn.</p><p data-characters=293 data-current-count=566 data-injectable=true>However, there was always tension with Brooklyn and most of that was because of her relationship with Christopher. In Apr. 2017, they told her she would no longer be able to see him, and she reluctantly agreed. That agreement was just lip service though, because she kept seeing him in secret.</p><p data-characters=154 data-current-count=154 data-injectable=false>So far, so good. Nothing more than a disagreement between a teen and her parents about who she’s dating. Nothing to suggest anything nefarious. Yet.</p><p data-characters=296 data-current-count=450 data-injectable=true>The hammer dropped on June 8, 2017, more than two months after the edict to never see Christopher again. Reynolds called 911 from the family home at 7:30 a.m. and said when she woke up the sliding glass door to her parent’s bedroom was broken, and it looked like someone had forced it open.</p><p data-characters=307 data-current-count=307 data-injectable=false>She told the operator that her mother and stepfather were both lying on the floor and neither was breathing. First responders rushed to the house and found Brooklyn and her sisters Madison Bryant and Caitlin Whitt waiting. They were taken to the police station while authorities combed over the crime scene.</p><p data-characters=328 data-current-count=635 data-injectable=true>When detectives questioned the girls who were in the home at the time, it struck them as odd that none of them heard anything, especially considering there was a struggle and multiple gunshots. It was so odd that they even investigated to see if it was even possible to not hear anything from outside the parent’s bedroom.</p><p data-characters=315 data-current-count=315 data-injectable=false>Another curiosity: the glass was shattered on the outside of the house, meaning someone inside the house broke it before the deadly incident. Brooklyn simply said the family had just gotten back from a vacation and that she found the bodies after she walked the dog in the morning, something her sisters confirmed.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=615 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=270 data-current-count=270 data-injectable=false>As they pressed, investigators became aware of the rift between Brooklyn and her parents. Then they found out about Christopher. When they questioned him, Christopher laid it on pretty thick. He said he wasn’t dating Brooklyn anymore, but they were still friends.</p><p data-characters=277 data-current-count=547 data-injectable=true>He also said he was close with the family and had helped them unload from vacation the night before the murder. When he left, he said, everything was peachy. A detective drove Christopher home and when he went into the house, he noticed a handgun under Christopher’s bed.</p><p data-characters=267 data-current-count=267 data-injectable=false>Christopher played dumb, saying he’d never even touched it. This struck investigators as odd, and after more investigation one of Christopher’s neighbors said they saw him practicing shooting a gun which looked similar to the one they found under the bed.</p><p data-characters=260 data-current-count=527 data-injectable=true>Detectives also re-questioned Brooklyn’s siblings, who contradicted Christopher’s story about being in the family’s good graces. Brooklyn’s bother, Austin Whitt, told the police that Christopher wasn’t even allowed near the house.</p><p data-characters=283 data-current-count=283 data-injectable=false>Detectives got a warrant to test the gun, and Christopher changed his story. He had fired the gun, he said, but only as practice. He said he was worried he’d get in trouble, so he lied. More questions emerged when detectives noticed that texts between Brooklyn had been erased.</p><p data-characters=312 data-current-count=595 data-injectable=true>Now that they were closing in, they brought him in for even more questioning. It worked. Christopher broke down when presented with evidence and admitted to the killings. He explained that he killed the parents to protect his girlfriend because they were “mean” and “violent” toward her.</p><p data-characters=325 data-current-count=325 data-injectable=false>He then revealed how the murders went down: He drove to their house in the middle of the night and Brooklyn let him in. He then walked into the master bedroom and shot Chara, waking up Henry. Henry was shot, tried to fight back, and he was shot again. He tried to crawl to the bathroom and Christopher shot him one last time.</p><p data-characters=239 data-current-count=564 data-injectable=true>Authorities then got the texts between Brooklyn and Christopher going over the murder plot. They were dead to rights. Brooklyn pleaded guilty to helping with the murder and got 23 years in prison for each parent, to be served concurrently.</p><p data-characters=248 data-current-count=248 data-injectable=false>She won’t be eligible for parole until 2037 when she’s 36. She’s <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">currently 23 years old</a>. Christopher took a plea deal and was sentenced to 60 years. He won’t be eligible for parole until 2074, when he’s 79 years old.</p><p data-characters=175 data-current-count=423 data-injectable=false>If you’re in the mood for more true crime, check out <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">our article on the bizarre Gypsy Rose Blanchard case</a> and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">the mother who murdered her family on New Year’s Day</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3ypu9ZmmKecXay1unnMrqmdnaKkwrR5056cp2WSp7ywt8uypWaqla67sLjDrGShnZylsqV5x56pZpqfrrOztcSnm2adqJqwtsDEZp%2Beql2lrrOxza2qaA%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fhow-and-why-murderous-teen-brooklyn-reynolds-helped-her-boyfriend-execute-her-parents.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fhow-and-why-murderous-teen-brooklyn-reynolds-helped-her-boyfriend-execute-her-parents.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fhow-and-why-murderous-teen-brooklyn-reynolds-helped-her-boyfriend-execute-her-parents.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fhow-and-why-murderous-teen-brooklyn-reynolds-helped-her-boyfriend-execute-her-parents.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fhow-and-why-murderous-teen-brooklyn-reynolds-helped-her-boyfriend-execute-her-parents.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fhow-and-why-murderous-teen-brooklyn-reynolds-helped-her-boyfriend-execute-her-parents.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./a-suspiciously-acclaimed-thriller-filmed-5-years-ago-and-ditched-by-disney-keeps-on-annihilating-the-box-office.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./a-suspiciously-acclaimed-thriller-filmed-5-years-ago-and-ditched-by-disney-keeps-on-annihilating-the-box-office.html>A suspiciously acclaimed thriller filmed 5 years ago and ditched by Disney keeps on annihilating the</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./dc-finally-beats-out-mcu-in-questionable-oscars-fan-poll.html>DC finally beats out MCU in questionable Oscars fan poll</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./dc-finally-beats-out-mcu-in-questionable-oscars-fan-poll.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
