He wore the number three shirt, as he did captain the&nbsp;U.S.&nbsp;during the&nbsp;2010 FIFA World Cup.&nbsp;Bocanegra made his debut for the club, on the opening game of the season, in a 3-1 loss against&nbsp;PSG.</p><p>On December 5, 2010, he scored his first goal for the club, in a 2-2 draw against&nbsp;Bordeaux; followed up his second goal in the&nbsp;Derby du Rhône, but couldn’t help Saint-Étienne a win, as they lost 4-1.

The club’s chief later described the complaint by Maribor regarding Bocanegra’s eligibility as ‘pathetic mischief-making’.</p><p>He scored his first goal for Rangers in the second leg of the Maribor tie as Rangers crashed out 3–2 on aggregate. Bocanegra scored his first league goal for the club on the 24th of September against&nbsp;Dunfermline Athletic&nbsp;in a 4–0 win.</p><p>His second goal came three months later, on December 17, 2011, during a 2-1 win over&nbsp;Inverness Caledonian Thistle.

Although many players departed because of this, Bocanegra’s future was uncertain after not attending training,&nbsp;as he wanted to leave in order to play at a higher level.</p><p>A few weeks later, on July 29, 2012, McCoist appointed Bocanegra captain for the first round of the Challenge Cup- a 2-1 win over&nbsp;Brechin City. After the game Bocanegra announced his intention to stay, vowing not to walk away from the club.</p><p>He then made six appearances at the start of the season. After being dropped by the national team,&nbsp;Bocanegra joined&nbsp;Racing de Santander on a season-long loan in an attempt to keep his international career alive.</p><h4><span>Racing Santander</span></h4><p>On August 31, 2012, Carlos Bocanegra joined Spanish Segunda División side Racing Santander on a season-long loan. Bocanegra expressed a desire to return to Rangers once his loan deal has expired.&nbsp;He made his debut for the club, on September 22, 2012, in a 1-0 win over&nbsp;CD Mirandés.</p><p>However, his time at Santander was considered “disastrous”,&nbsp;as he failed to start the remainder of the matches, though still played regularly, coming on as a substitute. The club was relegated to next division.</p><p>On April 9, 2013, Carlos announced on his&nbsp;Twitter&nbsp;page that he would return to&nbsp;Rangers&nbsp;for the&nbsp;2013–14&nbsp;season.&nbsp;Though announcing his return, U.S. National Team Manager&nbsp;Jürgen Klinsmann&nbsp;warned Carlos not to play for Rangers next season.</p><h4>Chivas USA</h4><p>In the summer of 2013, Bocanegra left Rangers&nbsp;and signed with&nbsp;Chivas USA. Chivas USA traded up the allocation order with&nbsp;Toronto FC&nbsp;to land his signature, sending a first-round&nbsp;2015 MLS SuperDraft pick and an international slot to the Canadian club.</p><p>Bocanegra retired at the end of the 2014 MLS season. In 2010, Carlos was purchased by Ligue 1 club Saint-Étienne, reportedly for a fee of £400,000. He later played for Scottish Premier League side Rangers and Racing Santander. Recently, on July 1, 2013, he signed for MLS club Chivas, USA.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=carlos-bocanegra-sports-executive-international></span><span>Carlos Bocanegra Sports executive International</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Carlos Bocanegra is a retired soccer player from the United States. He played as a defender for his team. He played for the United States at the 1999 FIFA World Youth Championship and earned his first senior cap for the U.S. on December 9, 2001, against South Korea.</p><p>He became a stalwart for the team in 2003, solidifying his position during the 2003 Gold Cup and leading all defenders with thirteen appearances during that year. During World Cup qualification in 2005, his role with the national team became less clear, as he bounced between roles at center back and left-back.</p><p>On May 2, 2006, Bocanegra was named to the United States World Cup roster for the tournament in Germany. He started two of three games at left-back during the 2006 World Cup.

On November 15, 2011, Bocanegra joined the 100 cap club achieving his 100th international cap in a friendly against Slovenia.</p><p>In March 2013, he was initially included in the preliminary team for the start of the final stage of World Cup qualification; he did not make the final team, however.</p><p>Bocanegra’s further exclusion from qualification, in part due to his unstable club situation, led to the appointment of Clint Dempsey as captain of the USMNT. Bocanegra was subsequently not a part of the team at the 2013 Gold Cup or the 2014 World Cup.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=carlos-bocanegra-after-football></span><span>Carlos Bocanegra After football</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Carlos Bocanegra was appointed the technical director of Atlanta United in March 2015.
